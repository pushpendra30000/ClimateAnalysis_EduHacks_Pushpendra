# Climate Change Visualization: A Century of Temperature Anomalies

This is a webgl-globe created inspired by google chome experiments used to visualize surface temperature anomalies over the past century. Data used in this project is taken from NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) using the 2 x 2 degree grid spacing from the Surface air temperature (no ocean data), 250km smoothing (9 MB). Structure for website layout was taken from Cathal Mc Daid's adaptive mobile spam globe.
